# tweeting-twitter-bot

This is a twitter bot that will tweet every minute. This bot uses the twitter api, cron, twitter-api-v2, and openai. The tweets are generated using OpenAI API and are tweeted by using the twitter API. To run this yourself, you will need to get an API key from OpenAI, and will also need to sign up for a developer account with Twitter in order to get an app key, app secret key, access token, and an access secret. Once you have these keys, you can start using the bot!
